         <p>The goal of the game is to identify and select the card that was initially chosen based on its color. When the game starts, a random card is chosen, and then all the cards shuffle. Your task is to find the original card by its color. If you select the correct card, you earn +1 point, but if you choose the wrong one, you lose -1 point. There is also a hint feature that can help you. When you click on the hint button, a bulb appears. Clicking on the hint will reveal the color of the chosen card, making it easier to find. Enjoy cool sounds</p>
